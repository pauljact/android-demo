  <!-- The following creates a cool color transition ('gradient')
       from the "top" of the container (list view item) to the bottom.
       You can specify the start color (here, white), middle color, and
       end color (here, gray); as well as using the 'angle' to determine
       where the 'top' and 'bottom' are (i.e. setting angle=90 would
       make the start color begin in top left corner, and angle down
       to bottom right corner.
       
       I had originally commented the gradient out here,
       as each product container has lots of items, and
       their backgrounds clash with the gradient background.
       However, setting each of these items' backgrounds to
       be transparent (by using 8 digits to specify the background
       the first two of which control transparency level) 
       means that you can see the parent's background, and
       thus you do maintain a consistent gradient experience
       across the whole list item. -->
  <gradient
      android:startColor="#FFFFFF"
      android:centerColor="#FFFFFF"
      android:endColor="#FFFFFF"
      android:angle="270" />
